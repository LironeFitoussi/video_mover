## üîß For Developers: Building from Source

If you want to build the application yourself or make changes to the code, follow these steps.

### What You Need First

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **Python** installed on your computer
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"
   - To check if Python is installed, open Command Prompt and type: `python --version`
   - You should see something like "Python 3.x.x"

2. **(Optional) Inno Setup** - Only needed if you want to create an installer
   - Download from: https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

### Step-by-Step Build Instructions

#### Step 1: Get the Code

**Option A: Using Git (if you have it installed)**
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to where you want to save the project (for example: `cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents`)
3. Type: `git clone <repository-url>`
4. Type: `cd video_mover`

**Option B: Download as ZIP**
1. Click the green "Code" button on this page
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
4. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```
   cd path\to\video_mover
   ```
   (Replace `path\to\video_mover` with the actual folder location)

#### Step 2: Install Required Tools

Open Command Prompt in the project folder and type:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will automatically download and install everything needed to build the application.

#### Step 3: (Optional) Create an Icon

If you want a custom icon for the application, run:
```
python create_icon.py
```
This step is optional - you can skip it if you don't need a custom icon.

#### Step 4: Build the Application

Run this command:
```
python build_exe.py
```

This will create a file called `VideoMover.exe` in a new folder called `dist`. The building process may take a few minutes - just wait for it to finish!

#### Step 5: Find Your Application

After building, you'll find `VideoMover.exe` in the `dist` folder. You can:
- Double-click it to run it
- Move it anywhere you want
- Share it with others (they don't need Python installed!)

---

## üöÄ Quick Build (All-in-One)

If you prefer a one-click approach, you can use the automated build script:

**Double-click:** `build_installer.bat`

This script will:
- Check that Python is installed
- Install all required tools
- Build the executable
- (If you have Inno Setup) Create an installer

Just wait for it to finish, then check the `dist` folder for `VideoMover.exe`!

---

## üì¶ Creating an Installer (Optional)

If you want to create a proper Windows installer (with Start Menu shortcuts and uninstaller):

### Step 1: Install Inno Setup
1. Download Inno Setup from: https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

### Step 2: Create the Installer
1. Make sure you've already built `VideoMover.exe` (see Step 4 above)
2. Open Inno Setup Compiler
3. Click "File" ‚Üí "Open"
4. Navigate to the `video_mover` folder and select `VideoMover.iss`
5. Press **F9** or click the "Build" button
6. The installer will be created in the `installer` folder

**Alternative Method (Command Line):**
Open Command Prompt in the project folder and run:
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" VideoMover.iss
```
(Adjust the path if Inno Setup is installed in a different location)

---

## üìÅ What Gets Created

After building, you'll find:

- **`dist/VideoMover.exe`** - The standalone application
  - This is all you need! You can run it, move it, or share it
  - No installation required

- **`installer/VideoMover_Setup_*.exe`** - Windows installer (if you created one)
  - This creates Start Menu shortcuts and an uninstaller
  - Better for distribution to other users

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Python is not recognized"
- Python isn't installed or isn't in your PATH
- Solution: Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### "pip is not recognized"
- This usually means Python isn't installed correctly
- Solution: Reinstall Python and make sure pip is included

### "Module not found" errors
- Some required files aren't installed
- Solution: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### Antivirus warnings
- Sometimes antivirus software flags newly created executables
- Solution: This is normal for PyInstaller-built apps. Add an exception or use "Allow" if prompted

### Build errors
- Try these steps in order:
  1. Run `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
  2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
  3. Close and reopen Command Prompt
  4. Try building again with `python build_exe.py`

### Installer won't build
- Make sure `VideoMover.exe` exists in the `dist` folder first
- Check that Inno Setup is installed correctly

## üß™ Testing Your Build

Before sharing your application:

1. ‚úÖ Run `dist/VideoMover.exe` and make sure it works
2. ‚úÖ Test moving some videos to make sure everything functions correctly
3. ‚úÖ If you created an installer, test installing it
4. ‚úÖ Test uninstalling (if using the installer)
5. ‚úÖ Try running on a different computer if possible

## üí° Tips

- The standalone `VideoMover.exe` can be run on any Windows computer without installing Python
- Keep the `dist/VideoMover.exe` file - it's your finished application!
- The `build/` folder can be deleted after building (it's just temporary files)
- If you make code changes, you'll need to rebuild the .exe for the changes to appear
